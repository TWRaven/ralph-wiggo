## Codebase Patterns
- Go module path: github.com/radvoogh/ralph-wiggo
- CLI entry point: cmd/ralph-wiggo/main.go
- Kong CLI framework: subcommands defined as struct fields on CLI type, with Run(globals *CLI) method
- Use `gb <branch-name>` for branch creation (git-machete), `gsn` for rebase+MR
- Fresh repos need an initial commit before `gb` works

## 2026-02-20 - US-001
- Implemented: Go project scaffolding with module init, kong CLI framework with 5 subcommands (run, prd, convert, serve, full) and global flags (--verbose, --model, --max-budget, --max-turns, --work-dir)
- Files changed: go.mod, go.sum, cmd/ralph-wiggo/main.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Kong uses struct tags for CLI definition — subcommands are embedded structs with `cmd:""` tag
  - Each subcommand needs a `Run(globals *CLI) error` method
  - `gb` requires at least one commit to exist in the repo
  - Global flags are on the parent CLI struct, automatically available to all subcommands
